                    <p>Department of Computer Science & Engineering was established in the year 1999, enriched with
                        strong resource persons and state-of-the-art laboratories. The department has always emphasized
                        on achieving academic and professional excellence.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The department was first accredited by the NBA visiting team in the year 2009, for the period
                        2009-2012 and again got the prestigious accreditation by NBA for the period of 3 years i.e.
                        2016-2019 (till June’19). Based on the excellent performance of the department it was again
                        accredited by the NBA team for a period of 3 years i.e. 2019 -2022 (till June, 2022).
